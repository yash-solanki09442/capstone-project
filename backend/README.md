# Backend Service

This directory will contain the Django REST API for the Capstone Project.

Currently, it is a placeholder until the Django project structure is initialized (Day 4 onward).

The backend will handle:
- Authentication
- Project management
- Task management
- Commenting system
- Database interactions

Real-time functionality will be implemented separately in a Node.js microservice.
